//! Defines an interfaces to receive parse data and construct ASTs.
//!
//! This allows the parser to remain agnostic of the required source
//! representation, and frees up the library user to substitute their own.
//! If one does not require a custom AST representation, this module offers
//! a reasonable default builder implementation.
//!
//! If a custom AST representation is required you will need to implement
//! the `Builder` trait for your AST. Otherwise you can provide the `DefaultBuilder`
//! struct to the parser if you wish to use the default AST implementation.
